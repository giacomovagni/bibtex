We find that homogamy has opposite effects on child care and couple specialization for high and low educated parents.

abstract = {Ambulatory assessment refers to the use of computer-assisted methodology for self-reports, behavior records, or physiological measurements, while the participant undergoes normal daily activities. Since the 1980s, portable microcomputer systems and physiological recorders/analyzers have been developed for this purpose. In contrast to their use in medicine, these new methods have hardly entered the domain of psychology. Questionnaire methods are still preferred, in spite of the known deficiencies of retrospective self-reports. Assessment strategies include: continuous monitoring, monitoring with time- and event-sampling methods, in-field psychological testing, field experimentation, interactive assessment, symptom monitoring, and self-management. These approaches are innovative and address ecological validity, context specificity, and are suitable for practical applications. The advantages of this methodology, as well as issues of acceptance, compliance, and reactivity are discussed. Many technical developments and research contributions have come from the German-speaking countries and the Netherlands. Nonetheless, the current Decade of Behavior (APA) calls for a more widespread use of such techniques and developments in assessment. This position paper seeks to make the case for this approach by demonstrating the advantages--and in some domains--necessities of ambulatory monitoring methodology for a behavioral science orientation in psychology. },

The paper examines (1) the temporal choices of time-use, the synchronous leisure of spouses and the extent to which spouses spend time together, and (2) tests whether spouses coordinate their working schedule so that they obtain more synchronous leisure, utilizing a control group of matched singles. The empirical results suggest (i) a positive effect of coordination on synchronous leisure, (ii) that market work and leisure timing are very intra-household dependent, and (iii) that although parents with small children and couples 40+ have more synchronized time-use than others, they seem to allocate less of this to their spouses.},

abstract = {Women are increasingly allocating time to the paid workforce, but there has not been a corresponding change by men allocating equivalent time to domestic and caring   labour. In the absence of sufficient institutional and domestic support, women continue to supply the bulk of time required to care for children. This amounts to only half a sex revolution and raises the question of whether becoming a parent creates welfare differences between mothers and fathers, and/or between mothers and non-mothers. This article addresses this issue by analysing data from the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Time Use Survey to investigate the impact of children on adults' (paid and unpaid) workload. The results show that the time impact of becoming a parent is considerable, but very unevenly distributed by sex. Having children markedly intensifies gender inequities in time allocation by increasing specialization and women's workload},

abstract = {Ambulatory assessment refers to the use of computer-assisted methodology for self-reports, behavior records, or physiological measurements, while the participant undergoes normal daily activities. Since the 1980s, portable microcomputer systems and physiological recorders/analyzers have been developed for this purpose. In contrast to their use in medicine, these new methods have hardly entered the domain of psychology. Questionnaire methods are still preferred, in spite of the known deficiencies of retrospective self-reports. Assessment strategies include: continuous monitoring, monitoring with time- and event-sampling methods, in-field psychological testing, field experimentation, interactive assessment, symptom monitoring, and self-management. These approaches are innovative and address ecological validity, context specificity, and are suitable for practical applications. The advantages of this methodology, as well as issues of acceptance, compliance, and reactivity are discussed. Many technical developments and research contributions have come from the German-speaking countries and the Netherlands. Nonetheless, the current Decade of Behavior (APA) calls for a more widespread use of such techniques and developments in assessment. This position paper seeks to make the case for this approach by demonstrating the advantages--and in some domains--necessities of ambulatory monitoring methodology for a behavioral science orientation in psychology. },

In the absence of sufficient institutional and domestic support, women continue to supply the bulk of time required to care for children. This amounts to only half a sex revolution and raises the question of whether becoming a parent creates welfare differences between mothers and fathers, and/or between mothers and non-mothers. This article addresses this issue by analysing data from the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Time Use Survey to investigate the impact of children on adults' (paid and unpaid) workload. The results show that the time impact of becoming a parent is considerable, but very unevenly distributed by sex. Having children markedly intensifies gender inequities in time allocation by increasing specialization and women's workload},

Family configurations based on blood connections, as well as those based on partnership, provide a “binding” type of social capital, i.e. densely connected family networks with low individual centrality, whereas family configurations based on friendship provide a “bridging” type of social capital, i.e. sparsely connected family networks with high individual centrality.

unattractive for cohabitors. Drawing from work on the emergence
of commitment, we argue that cohabitors are more likely to remain
together under conditions of equality. Using data from the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics, we test these ideas by modeling the
stability of married and long-term cohabiting unions in the
United States. We find that married couples who adopt a more
specialized division of labor are less likely to divorce, but the
effect is modest. Among cohabitors, partners whose employment and
earnings are increasingly similar face sharply reduced risks of
breaking up, but the effect is asymmetric: Inequality is more
disruptive when the female cohabitor earns more than her partner.},

abstract = {Objectives. This research assessed how parents' transfers of
sentiment, time, and financial assets to their adolescent/young
adult children affect the children's propensity in middle age to
provide social support to their aging parents. We tested whether
the mechanism of long-term intergenerational exchange is better
modeled as a return on investment, an insurance policy triggered
by the longevity or physical frailty of parents, or the result of
altruistic (or other nonreciprocal) motivations on the part of
adult children.Methods. Models were examined with 6 waves of data
from the University of Southern California Longitudinal Study of
Generations. The sample consisted of 501 children who
participated in the 1971 survey and who had at least 1 parent
surviving in 1985. Growth curve modeling was applied to predict
average levels and rates of change in social support provided to
mothers and fathers between 1985 and 1997 as a function of early
parental transfers of affection, association, and tangible
resources to their children.Results. Children who spent more time
in shared activities with their mothers and fathers in 1971
provided more support to them on average. Receiving greater
financial support from parents in 1971 raised the marginal rate
at which support provided by children increased over time.
Maternal health operated synergistically with early affection to
produce greater levels of support. Both levels and rates of
increase in support from children were positive, even for
children who received no early transfers from their
parents.Discussion. The results offer some support for
investment, insurance, and altruistic models of intergenerational
exchange. Sharing time in activities provides a direct return to
the parent that is characteristic of an investment strategy,
whereas financial transfers provide a time-contingent return that
is characteristic of an insurance mechanism. That affection
triggers greater support to more functionally impaired mothers
suggests that emotionally investing in children as a health
insurance mechanism may be based on the greater moral equity
accorded to mothers. The motivation of adult children to provide
social support to their older parents is partially rooted in
earlier family experiences and guided by an implicit social
contract that ensures long-term reciprocity.},

abstract = {This article addresses the question of the effects of cost setting on the kind of temporal patterns optimal matching (OM) can uncover when applied to social science data. It is argued that the balance between indel (insertion and deletion) and substitution costs determines what kind of socio-temporal pattern can be brought to light. Insertion and deletion operations favor identically coded states irrespective of their locations whereas substitutions focus on contemporaneous similarities. The lower the ratio of substitution to indel costs, the closer OM is to the Hamming distance where only substitutions are used. The higher this ratio, the closer OM is to the Levenshtein II distance, which amounts to finding the longest common subsequence. When the timing of sequences is crucial, substitutions should be favored over indels and their costs should be carefully fixed. Ideally, substitution costs should vary with time to better take into account the timing of the sequences studied. As indels warp time, hence the timing of sequences, it is suggested to use only substitution operations with time-dependent costs inversely proportional to transition frequencies whenever the timing of sequences is central. This OM variant, coined dynamic Hamming matching, is applied to the question of the scheduling of paid work where timing is critical (1985 and 1999 French time use surveys, N = 7,908) along with three classical OM variants (Hamming and Levenshtein I and II). As expected, the two Hamming dissimilarity measures fare better to identify patterns of workday schedules, as measured by entropy, than the two Levenshtein ones. ER -},

decreased from 1940 to 1960 but increased from 1960 to 2003. From
1960 to the early 1970s, increases in educational homogamy were
generated by decreasing intermarriage among groups of relatively
well-educated persons. College graduates, in particular; were
increasingly likely to marry each other rather than those with
less education. Beginning in the early 1970s, however; continued
increases in the odds of educational homogamy were generated by
decreases in intermarriage at both ends of the education
distribution. Most striking is the decline in the odds that those
with very low levels of education marry up. Intermarriage between
college graduates and those with ``some college'' continued to
decline but at a more gradual pace. As intermarriage declined at
the extremes of the education distribution, intermarriage among
those in the middle portion of the distribution increased. These
trends, which are similar for a broad cross section of married
couples and for newlyweds, are consistent with a growing social
divide between those with very low levels of education and those
with more education in the United States.},

Six themes in the contemporary sociology of time (up to 1982) are examined: (1) time perspective and time orientation; (2) temporal ordering and social structure: time reckoning and the social construction of time schedules; (3) the time structure of specific social systems and professions: the economy, the legal system, the family, and formal organizations; (4) the evolution of social consciousness of time; (5) social change and time; and (6) the concern with time in social theory and methodology.

We analyzed a dynamic social network comprising 43,553 students, faculty, and staff at a large university, in which interactions between individuals are inferred from time-stamped e-mail headers recorded over one academic year and are matched with affiliations and attributes. We found that network evolution is dominated by a combination of effects arising from network topology itself and the organizational structure in which the network is embedded. In the absence of global perturbations, average network properties appear to approach an equilibrium state, whereas individual properties are unstable.},

In contrast to ideas of conspicuous consumption based on display, we present a concept of ‘inconspicuous consumption' relating to an imagined future use of purchases already made. Expensive leisure goods that symbolize a wished-for self-identity or lifestyle are purchased by high-income earners with little leisure time. From the point of view of the production sector, the purpose is achieved and a sale is made. However, the purchased goods remain ‘in storage'at home as symbols of a potential but unrealized and, in the meantime, unrealizable future. We illustrate different modalities of the practices of inconspicuous consumption and distinguish it from other consumption practices.},

to seek accurate descriptions or reliable indicators. Continued
research on data quality is needed; beyond improved samples and
further investigation of the informant accuracy/reliability

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This research aimed to chart age-related changes in 11 dimensions of social relations during later life. We also examined interpersonal differences in intra-individual changes.

METHODS: We used hierarchical linear modeling with data from a nationwide survey of 1,103 elders who were interviewed up to four times over a 10-year period.

RESULTS: Age-related changes in social relations varied across the different dimensions, and significant interpersonal differences existed in these trajectories. Emotional support was relatively stable with advancing age, whereas other types of received support (i.e., tangible and informational) increased with age and levels of provided support declined. Furthermore, the findings revealed declines in contact with friends, support satisfaction, and anticipated support. These changes were not uniform throughout the sample, as indicated by significant random effects with respect to the intercepts and slopes in virtually each model. Gender and socioeconomic status accounted for some of this variation.

DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the dynamic nature of social relationships in late life. In addition, the findings both provide evidence of older adults managing their social ties to meet the challenges of aging and suggest the importance of the interplay between giving and receiving support.},

the level of celibacy declined in the second half of the 19th
century. This weakening of the European marriage pattern (EMP)

the standard of living, but a more far-reaching interpretation
is that the erosion of the EMP was part of a cultural shift
characterized by the rise of a new, less instrumental and more
egalitarian view on marriage and partner selection. The latter
vision implies the increase of the preference for a same age
marriage. We test this explanation by using a combined

from an institution to a companionship. The emphasis is on the
family as a unity of interacting persons that shapes the
personality development of its members and is itself adaptable
to change. The ideal-type method is employed; there is an
extensive use of personal documents. Part I, The Family in
Social Change, presents the changing family patterns in five
different situations. Part II, The Family and Personality
Development, discusses the ways in which interaction within the
family stimulates or frustrates the personality growth of its
members. It considers the effects on personality development of
cultural and psychogenic conditioning within the family; the
effects of parental expectations on children; and the role of
the family in determining how fundamental wishes will find
expression. Part III, Family Organization, discusses courtship
and mate selection, marital success and adjustment, and family
unity, emphasizing the interaction of family members as a vital
element. Part IV, Family Disorganization and Reorganization,
treats disorganization as a result of transition in the family
and the larger society. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA,

The authors' approach brings conceptual and empirical clarity to an important area of study. Their model describes how parents transmit cultural capital to their children and how children convert cultural capital into educational success. It also provides a behavioral framework for interpreting parental investments in cultural capital. The authors review results from existing empirical research on the role of cultural capital in education to demonstrate the usefulness of their model for interpretative purposes, and they use National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979—Children and Young Adults survey data to test some of its implications.},

OM as applied to social science data are all around, but largely proprietary. Dynamic pattern search algorithms are used throughout the commercial sector. Sociologist Joel H. Levine's article "But What Have You Done for Us Lately? Commentary on Abbott and Tsay" makes three basic arguments. First, it says that OM has passed its youth and needs to move on to serious results. Second, it feels the present article should have criticized the work reviewed more sharply, particularly in terms of its validity. Third, Levine argues that sequence is merely a frame of reference, not a model, but that OM is a tool kit for building models and, hence, must meet the standards of modeling. The author says that these are basically descriptive results, and as he points out in the article, it may well be that the main use of pattern search methods in social science will be for parsimonious description.

This reality assumes (1) that the social world consists of fixed entities with variable attributes, (2) that cause cannot flow from "small" to "large" attributes/events, (3) that causal attributes have only one causal pattern at once, (4) that the sequence of events does not influence their outcome, (5) that the "careers" of entities are largely independent, and (6) that causal attributes are generally independent of each other. The paper discusses examples of these assumptions in empirical work, consider standard and new methods addressing them, and briefly explores alternative models for reality that employ demographic, sequential, and network perspectives.},

Contemporary perspectives typically stress child well-being, women's caregiving burden, or gender equality. The tensions among these can be resolved in societies that combine intensive parental time for children with a gender-egalitarian division of labor. Social and labor market policies that would support such a society are the most developed in the Social Democratic countries, with the Conservative countries of continental Europe and the Liberal English-speaking countries lagging substantially (most markedly, the United states). That policy variation appears to shape cross-country variation in crucial parent and child outcomes.},

However, even after a decade of conceptual and empirical work on this subject, there is still considerable disagreement about whether bonding social capital is a collective resource that benefits communities or societies, or whether its health benefits are associated with people, their personal networks and support. Using data from the 2000 and 2002 Health Survey for England this study found that, in line with earlier research, personal levels of social support contribute to a better self-reported health status. The study also suggests that social capital is additionally important for people's health. In both datasets the aggregate social trust variable was significantly related to self-rated health before and after controlling for differences in socio-demographics and/or individual levels of social support. The results were corroborated in the second dataset with an alternative indicator of social capital. These results show that bonding social capital collectively contributes to people's self-rated health over and above the beneficial effects of personal social networks and support.},

It distinguishes four sources of social capital and examines their dynamics. Applications of the concept in the sociological literature emphasize its role in social control, in family support, and in benefits mediated by extrafamilial networks. I provide examples of each of these positive functions. Negative consequences of the same processes also deserve attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant examples. Recent writings on social capital have extended the concept from an individual asset to a feature of communities and even nations. The final sections describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations. I argue that, as shorthand for the positive consequences of sociability, social capital has a definite place in sociological theory. However, excessive extensions of the concept may jeopardize its heuristic value.},

Special emphasis is put on the multiple ways of visualizing sequences. The core element of the package is the state sequence object in which we store the set of sequences together with attributes such as the alphabet, state labels and the color palette. The functions can then easily retrieve this information to ensure presentation homogeneity across all printed and graphical displays.

The measure of well-being used is directly derived from the subjective assessment of the enjoyment of activities as recorded in time-use diaries. It is shown that this measure yeilds plausible results which share many of the characteristics of other measures of well-being. In addition, since the diaries used in the analysis were collected from couples it has also been possible to investigate the association between the well-being of partners. It is shown that in multivariate analyses including both time-use and socio-demographic variables the effect of a partner's well-being has by far the most significant impact on individual well-being. It is argued that this combination of information offers a useful means of analysing the relationship between time-use, well-being and the couple relationship. In this sense the analysis cross-cuts some of the conventional disciplinary boundaries which have served to separate the study of emotional relationships and psychological states from that of the daily activities of households.},

abstract = {Crime is seldom considered as an outcome in public health research. Yet major theoretical and empirical developments in the field of criminology during the past 50 years suggest that the same social environmental factors which predict geographic variation in crime rates may also be relevant for explaining community variations in health and wellbeing. Understanding the causes of variability in crime across countries and across regions within a country will help us to solve one of the enduring puzzles in public health, viz. why some communities are healthier than others. The purpose of this paper is to present a conceptual framework for investigating the influence of the social context on community health, using crime as the indicator of collective wellbeing. We argue that two sets of societal characteristics influence the level of crime: the degree of relative deprivation in society (for instance, measured by the extent of income unequality), and the degree of cohesiveness in social relations among citizens (measured, for instance, by indicators of 'social capital' and 'collective efficacy'). We provided a test of our conceptual framework using state-level ecologic data on violent crimes and property crimes within the USA. Violent crimes (homicide, assault, robbery) were consistently associated with relative deprivation (income inequality) and indicators of low social capital. Among property crimes, burglary was also associated with deprivation and low social capital. Areas with high crime rates tend also to exhibit higher mortality rates from all causes, suggesting that crime and population health share the same social origins. Crime is thus a mirror of the quality of the social environment.},

organize the empirical literature on the consequences of divorce
for adults and children. My review draws on research in the
1990s to answer five questions: How do individuals from married
and divorced families differ in well-being? Are these
differences due to divorce or to selection? Do these differences
reflect a temporary crisis to which most people gradually adapt
or stable life strains that persist more or less indefinitely?
What factors mediate the effects of divorce on individual
adjustment? And finally, what are the moderators (protective
factors) that account for individual variability in adjustment
to divorce? In general, the accumulated research suggests that
marital dissolution has the potential to create considerable
turmoil in people's lives. But people vary greatly in their
reactions. Divorce benefits some individuals, leads others to
experience temporary decrements in well-being, and forces others
on a downward trajectory from which they might never recover
fully. Understanding the contingencies under which divorce leads
to these diverse outcomes is a priority for future research.},

We find that time in the major life domains is adversely associated with sports/fitness participation, although more so for men. Considering this gender difference in the effects of the time in the major life domains also helps us better reveal the oft-noted gender gap in sports/fitness participation. Moreover, we find the negative association of time spent in the major life domains and time on sports/fitness participation is stronger for married than single persons, whereas this association does not vary in size by parental status. Implications of these findings for future research on gender stratification in sports/fitness are discussed.},

Orientational family members (Kuhn, 1964) are likely to be perceived as being included in relatively large and unbounded family contexts. To deal with the complexity of those contexts, one needs to develop an approach that makes it possible to analyze many relationships in a single model. Such an approach is presented in this article, which considers family contexts as cognitive networks (Marsden, 1990). To illustrate how statistical and graphical network methods can be applied empirically to those contexts, perceived relationships among orientational family members of 25 female students were analyzed in relation to balance theory (Heider, 1958).},

Secondly, we discuss some direct sociological critiques of the use of time-use diary methodology. We argue that much of the substance of these critiques relies upon a limited conception of such diaries, based upon relatively crude early analyses of time-use data. In fact diary materials have the potential to provide measures of many of the aspects of the experience of time which they have been accused of ignoring. We present a series of example analyses which consider: the rhythm and sequencing of daily activities; the occurrence of multiple simultaneous activities; the duration of specific activities; the enjoyment of time spent in different activities; and the social context of activities.},

The question that we address here is: is it possible to specify public policy regime effects on patterns of time use? Some hypotheses are advanced concerning likely patterns of relationship between the liberal and social-democratic public policy regimes and the use of time in these societies. The data used are drawn from a multinational time-use data archive held at the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex. A clear relationship is found between public policy regime and paid work time (those in liberal market regimes work longer on average), however, there are no consistent regime effects found either for the amount of time spent in different leisure activities or in respect of the domestic division of labor. The conclusion is that, at least in relation to the time-use variables used in the these analyses, the gender division of domestic labor and type of leisure activity represent different dimensions of variability than those commonly used in the classification of public policy regimes.},

Andrew J. Cherlin's three decades of study have shown him that marriage in America is a social and political battlefield in a way that it isn't in other developed countries. Americans marry and divorce more often and have more live-in partners than Europeans, and gay Americans have more interest in legalizing same-sex marriage. The difference comes from Americans' embrace of two contradictory cultural ideals: marriage, a formal commitment to share one's life with another; and individualism, which emphasizes personal choice and self-development. Religion and law in America reinforce both of these behavioral poles, fueling turmoil in our family life and heated debate in our public life. Cherlin's incisive diagnosis is an important contribution to the debate and points the way to slowing down the partnership merry-go-round.},

Families and Households. These 5 data sets reveal substantial and
persistent long-term trends toward the endorsement of gender
equality in families, which may have plateaued at very high
levels in recent years. There have also been important and
continuing long-term trends toward individual autonomy and
tolerance toward a diversity of personal and family behaviors as
reflected in increased acceptance of divorce, premarital sex,
unmarried cohabitation, remaining single, and choosing to be
childless. At the same time, marriage and family life remain
important in the cultural ethos, with large and relatively stable
fractions of young people believing that marriage and family life
are important and planning marriage and the bearing and rearing

This paper examines this enlarging solitary part of daily life as a distinct “experiential niche” having unique potentials and liabilities. The paper synthesizes a program of research in which people of different ages have provided reports on their experiences at random times during the day, including times when they are alone. Findings show that the immediate experience of daily solitude is usually one of loneliness and passivity. This is particularly true in adolescence; for older samples aloneness becomes both more common and less emotionally negative. At the same time, adolescents who spend at least some portion of their time alone appear to be better adjusted, perhaps because solitude facilitates the adolescent developmental tasks of individuation and identity formation, while in adulthood and old age, spending large amounts of time alone is more likely to be correlated with poor adjustment.},

The types of conjugal interactions characterized by a strong emphasis on partners' autonomy trigger in the short term a significantly larger number of problems and conflicts. Conjugal dissatisfaction and separation are more likely in Associative and Parallel types of functioning.

abstract = {The social scientific analysis of social class is attracting renewed interest given the accentuation of economic and social inequalities throughout the world. The most widely validated measure of social class, the Nuffield class schema, developed in the 1970s, was codified in the UK's National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) and places people in one of seven main classes according to their occupation and employment status. This principally distinguishes between people working in routine or semi-routine occupations employed on a ‘labour contract' on the one hand, and those working in professional or managerial occupations employed on a ‘service contract' on the other. However, this occupationally based class schema does not effectively capture the role of social and cultural processes in generating class divisions. We analyse the largest survey of social class ever conducted in the UK, the BBC's 2011 Great British Class Survey, with 161,400 web respondents, as well as a nationally representative sample survey, which includes unusually detailed questions asked on social, cultural and economic capital. Using latent class analysis on these variables, we derive seven classes. We demonstrate the existence of an ‘elite', whose wealth separates them from an established middle class, as well as a class of technical experts and a class of ‘new affluent' workers. We also show that at the lower levels of the class structure, alongside an ageing traditional working class, there is a ‘precariat' characterised by very low levels of capital, and a group of emergent service workers. We think that this new seven class model recognises both social polarisation in British society and class fragmentation in its middle layers, and will attract enormous interest from a wide social scientific community in offering an up-to-date multi-dimensional model of social class.},

The small body of previous research has either used qualitative approaches or coded open-ended responses to survey questions about causes of health and illness or of inequalities between areas. We examined lay perceptions by asking a direct question and using a quantitative, multivariate approach. Residents in three age groups (25, 45 and 65 years old) living in two socially contrasting localities in Glasgow, Scotland, were asked who were more likely to have accidents, cancer, heart disease, mental illness, to be fitter, and to live longer: rich people, poor people, or both equally. Across all the health categories, those in lower social classes or from poorer neighbourhoods were equally or less likely than their more socially advantaged counterparts to say the poor had worse health. In a model containing age, sex, class and locality, those in lower social classes and in the poorer locality were significantly less likely to say that richer people live longer (OR: 0.5). We have therefore confirmed earlier observations that those most at risk of ill health may be less likely to acknowledge the social gradient in health. We suggest a need to examine this apparent paradox in other contexts and in more detail, using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

to associate with equally educated partners; (b) educational
expansion increases contact opportunities for equally educated

the strength and resilience of intergenerational solidarity over
time. I also indicate that family multigenerational relations are
increasingly diverse because of (a) changes in family structure,
involving divorce and stepfamily relationships; (b) the increased
longevity of kin; (c) the diversity of intergenerational
relationship ``types.'' Drawing on the family research legacy of
Ernest W. Burgess, I frame my arguments in terms of historical
family transitions and hypotheses. Research from the Longitudinal
Study of Generations is presented to demonstrate the strengths of
multigenerational ties over time and why it is necessary to look
beyond the nuclear family when asking whether families are still

abstract = {This study uses the  family time economies' concept for a nuanced investigation of family work-care experiences in 20 Australian nursing families. The family time economy captures information on the management and coordination of work and care responsibilities in families. Our study investigates how nurses were utilizing nursing flexibility to support time for caring for their families. We report on couple interview research which offered important insights into how shift work and family time are described and negotiated between partners caring for children. The study shows that the complex work schedules generated by shift work are reflected in domestic life, as nurses and their partners use available employment flexibility to ensure they have time for family care. The  taylorized' allotment of time within the family competed with the desire to make, and preserve, free and unstructured family time, reflecting the incursion of, and resistance to, industrial temporalities in the familial sphere.},

A more comprehensive but grounded theory of social capital is presented that develops a distinction between bonding, bridging, and linking social capital.

Until the publication of this groundbreaking work, no one had so deftly diagnosed the harm that these broken bonds have wreaked on our physical and civic health, nor had anyone exalted their fundamental power in creating a society that is happy, healthy, and safe. Like defining works from the past, such as The Lonely Crowd and The Affluent Society, and like the works of C.

Coleman's (1990) theory of social capital emphasizes the roles of mothers and fathers in enhancing the life prospects of their children. However, Coleman's (1988) analysis of family migration and high school completion found an anomalous null effect of parental support. Elder's (1994) life course perspective on "linked lives" suggests that parental involvement with their children can have interactive effects as well as main effects in mitigating losses of community social capital resulting from a family's moves. Following this lead and using more elaborate measures, we find that the negative effects of family migration are significantly more pronounced in families with uninvolved fathers and unsupportive mothers. In these families the diminished social capital provided by parents does not compensate for the community social capital lost as a result of a family's move.},

This article aims to answer those questions on the basis of a large representative sample indicating couples' social and generational characteristics. Five styles were empirically identified, associated with sharply varied frequency levels for problems and open conflict. Prevalent conjugal conflict coincides with a strong tendency for spouse or partner autonomy, sex-differentiated roles, and couple self-enclosure. These results are largely due to the differential effect of the conflict-management modes inherent in the various interaction styles, these in turn influenced by couples' social characteristics and position. No increasing standardization of conjugal interaction modes was observed; indeed, advanced modernity seems characterized instead by several fairly distinct models highly dependent on position in the social structure.},

abstract = {Cross-national trends in paid and unpaid work time over the last 40 years reveal a slow and incomplete convergence of women's and men's work patterns. A simplistic extrapolation would indicate a 70—80 year process of gender convergence, with the year 2010 representing an approximate mid-point. However, in conformity with the expectations of gender theory, time use data show that gender segregation in domestic work is quite persistent over time. Women still do the bulk of routine housework and caring for family members while men have increased their contributions disproportionately to non-routine domestic work, suggesting that gender ideologies and the associated ‘doing' of gender in interaction remain important features of the division of domestic labour. The effects of institutional barriers are also apparent, with differential changes in women's proportional contribution to routine housework and caring activities related to different national policy clusters.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that the degree of social cohesion is an important determinant of population health status. Citizens living in societies with a high degree of social cohesion - characterized by strong social networks and high levels of interpersonal trust - seem to be healthier than those living in socially disorganized societies. Epidemiologists have become interested in notions of civil society and social capital to explain variations in health across societies. The purpose of the present paper was to examine the role of social capital in the Russian mortality crisis. Social capital has been defined as those features of social organization - such as the density of civic associations, levels of interpersonal trust, and norms of reciprocity - that act as resources for individuals, and facilitate collective action. A civil society is one that is rich in stocks of social capital. Various scholars have argued that one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Soviet regime was the paucity of civil society. Using household survey data from the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion research (VTsIOM), we carried out a cross-sectional, ecologic analysis of the association between indicators of social capital and mortality rates across 40 regions of Russia. We found associations between indicators of social capital (mistrust in government, crime, quality of work relations, civic engagement in politics) and life expectancy, as well as mortality rates. In the absence of civil society, it is believed that far more people in post-Soviet Russia rely on informal sources of support (friends, family) to deal with their day to day problems. Those lacking such sources of support may have been especially vulnerable to the economic hardships following the transformation to a market economy.},

and satisfaction is less robust than previously believed, and
that it depends on how often spouses pursue activities that
reflect their own and their partner's leisure preferences. Over
time, involvement in leisure liked by husbands but disliked by
wives, whether as a couple or by husbands alone, is both a cause
and a consequence of wives' dissatisfaction.},

Changes are compared for fathers in dual-earner couples with different levels of education.The findings illustrate two contrasting changing differences: a ‘catch-up' effect over time between fathers with different educational attainment in the case of domestic labour; and in the case of child care, a widening of the gap by education. The challenges posed by these changing differences for common structural explanations of change in family work are discussed.},

abstract = {In an effort at theoretical clarification, the authors reviewed 45 recent articles reporting empirical research employing the concept of 'social capital'. The literature is roughly equally divided between those who treat social capital as an independent variable and those who consider it as a dependent variable, and between those who operationalize the concept principally in terms of norms, values and attitudes and those who choose a more social structural operationalization, invoking social networks, organizations and linkages. Work on social capital as a mainly normative variable is dominated by political scientists and economists, while sociologists and a wide range of applied social scientists utilize more social structural understandings of the term. We find little to recommend in the use of 'social capital' to represent the norms, values and attitudes of the civic culture argument. We present empirical, methodological and theoretical arguments for the irrelevance of 'generalized social trust', in particular, as a significant factor in the health of democracies or economic development. Social structural interpretations of social capital, on the other hand, have demonstrated considerable capacity to draw attention to, and illuminate, the many ways in which social resources are made available to individuals and groups for individual or group benefit, which we take to be the prime focus and central attraction of the social capital concept. The paper concludes by elaborating a context-dependent conceptualization of social capital as access plus resources, and cautions against 'over-networked' conceptualizations that equate social capital with access alone.},

abstract = {There has recently been much debate about the influence of social capital on health outcomes. In particular it has been suggested that levels of social capital vary from place to place and that such variations may account for previously unexplained between-place variations in health outcomes. As yet few studies exist of the influence of small-area variations in social capital on health outcomes. One reason for this is the difficulty of obtaining indicators for small areas such as electoral wards in England, and we describe a method used to derive what we term 'synthetic estimates' of aspects of social capital by linking coefficients produced from multi-level analyses of national survey datasets to census data. We produce estimates for electoral wards in England and apply these in multi-level models of our response variable, the probability of survival of individuals surveyed in the Health and Lifestyle Survey of England. We report various combinations of models incorporating individual attributes, health-related behaviours, area measures of deprivation, and area measures of social capital. Our overall conclusion is that we find little support, at this spatial scale, for the proposition that area measures of social capital exert a beneficial effect on health outcomes. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

how these work as tools of family display. For some families,
displays are used to affirm an idiosyncratic sense of their
family through drawing on particular cultural motifs of ‘family'.
For other families, practices of display work to smooth over
challenges from within. Displays can also be more normative,
confirming wider hegemonic models of what the family is. Thus,
while displays --- and therefore ideas of family --- do take
different forms, nonetheless they also demonstrate that, as Smart
suggests, people's personal lives need always to be understood as
embedded in particular social and cultural worlds, rather than a
function of lone, autonomous individuals.},

abstract = {A survey among 1,523 married and cohabiting couples in the
Netherlands is used to describe the extent to which couples have
lifestyles characterized by separate leisure pursuits. Four types
of leisure are examined: visiting friends and family,
entertainment, outdoor recreation, and indoor leisure. For these
activities, we find that contemporary couples cannot be
characterized as highly individualized. Next, we analyze why some
couples have a more separated lifestyle than others. Hypotheses
are developed about the life cycle of the couple, the couple's
work life, social and cultural homogamy, and value orientations.
Multivariate analyses show that life cycle factors are an
important determinant of separate lifestyles, whereas evidence
for the role of values and homogamy is modest. We also present
evidence revealing the time constraints that children and work
schedules pose for realizing a joint lifestyle, but we do not
find that spouses in dual-earner couples generally operate more
separately than do other couples.},

This article argues that existing studies on cultural capital and educational success fail to distinguish the different channels through which cultural capital promotes educational success. Following Bourdieu, the article proposes that for cultural capital to promote educational success three conditions must hold: (1. parents must possess cultural capital, (2. they must transfer their cultural capital to children, and (3. children must absorb cultural capital and convert it into educational success. This research develops an empirical model that analyzes the significance of the three effects with respect to Danish children's choice of secondary education. Denmark is well-suited for this study because access to secondary education is particularly meritocratic. The empirical analysis shows that all three channels through which cultural capital affects educational success are important.},

Growing evidence suggests that the distribution of income-in addition to the absolute standard of living enjoyed by the poor-is a key determinant of population health. A large gap between rich people and poor people leads to higher mortality through the breakdown of social cohesion. The recent surge in income inequality in many countries has been accompanied by a marked increase in the residential concentration of poverty and affluence. Residential segregation diminishes the opportunities for social cohesion. Income inequality has spillover effects on society at large, including increased rates of crime and violence, impeded productivity and economic growth, and the impaired functioning of representative democracy. The extent of inequality in society is often a consequence of explicit policies and public choice. Reducing income inequality offers the prospect of greater social cohesiveness and better population health.},

What differentiates couples exhibiting gender specialization or segregation in household tasks from those couples who share tasks? Using newly released data from the National Survey of Families and Households, this study has two major objectives. First, a new summary measure of the gender-based segregation of family labor is presented. Second, sources of intercouple variation in the sex segregation of household labor are examined, focusing especially on the effects of time availability, family power, and gender role ideology. The results indicate that, even in the late 1980s, American couples exhibited highly sex-segregated family work patterns, including those couples in which the male partner contributes many hours to housework. The study shows that American males would have to reallocate over 60{\%} of their family work time to other tasks before sex equality in the division of labor is achieved. The analysis indicates that this gender-based division of family work is symptomatic of continuing gender inequality and gender role socialization in American society.},

The analysis is carried out within an econometric model of population health in 19 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries using panel data covering three different time periods. Social capital is measured by the proportion of people who say that that they generally trust other people and by membership in voluntary associations. The model performs well in explaining health outcomes. We find very little statistically significant evidence that the standard indicators of social capital have a positive effect on population health. By contrast, per capita income and the proportion of health expenditure financed by the government are both significantly and positively associated with better health outcomes. The paper casts doubt upon the widely accepted hypothesis that social capital has a positive effect on health and illustrates the importance of testing this kind of hypothesis in an extended model. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Second Demographic Transition (SDT) since the theory was first
formulated in 1986. The first part recapitulates the
foundations of the theory, and documents the spread of the SDT
to the point that it now covers most European populations.
Also for Europe, it focuses on the relationship between the
SDT and the growing heterogeneity in period fertility levels.
It is shown that the current positive relationship between SDT
and TFR levels is not a violation of the SDT theory, but the
outcome of a ``split correlation'' with different
sub-narratives concerning the onset of fertility postponement
and the degree of subsequent recuperation in two parts of
Europe. The second part of the article addresses the issue of
whether the SDT has spread or is currently spreading in
industrialized Asian countries. Evidence gathered for Japan,
South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan is presented.
That evidence pertains to both the macro-level (national
trends in postponement of marriage and parenthood, rise of
cohabitation) and the micro-level (connections between
individual values orientations and postponement of
parenthood). Strong similarities are found with SDT patterns
in Southern Europe, except for the fact that parenthood is
still very rare among Asian cohabiting partners.},

The family is becoming more of an elective relationship, an association of individuals who each brings to it their own interests, experiences and plans, and who are each subjected to different controls, risks and constraints. It is therefore necessary to devote much more effort than in the past to the holding together of these different biographies. Whereas people could once fall back on rules and rituals, the prospect now is of a staging of everyday life, an acrobatics of balancing and coordinating. This does not mean that the traditional family is simply disappearing. But it is losing the monopoly it had for so long. Its quantitative significance is declining as new lifestyles appear and spread. These in all their intermediary and secondary forms represent the future of families, or what I call the contours of the `post-familial family'.},

abstract = {National news reports periodically proclaim that American life
is lonelier than ever, and new books on the subject with titles
like Bowling Alone generate considerable anxiety about the
declining quality of Americans' social ties. Still Connected
challenges such concerns by asking a simple yet significant
question: have Americans' bonds with family and friends changed
since the 1970s, and, if so, how? Noted sociologist Claude
Fischer examines long-term trends in family ties and friendships
and paints an insightful and ultimately reassuring portrait of
Americans' personal relationships. Still Connected analyzes
forty years of survey research to address whether and how
Americans' personal ties have changed---their involvement with
relatives, the number of friends they have and their contacts
with those friends, the amount of practical and emotional
support they are able to count on, and how emotionally tied they
feel to these relationships. The book shows that Americans today
have fewer relatives than they did forty years ago and that
formal gatherings have declined over the decades---at least
partially as a result of later marriages and more women in the
work force. Yet neither the overall quantity of personal
relationships nor, more importantly, the quality of those
relationships has diminished. Americans' contact with relatives
and friends, as well as their feelings of emotional
connectedness, has changed relatively little since the 1970s.
Although Americans are marrying later and single people feel
lonely, few Americans report being socially isolated and the
percentage who do has not really increased. Fischer maintains
that this constancy testifies to the value Americans place on
family and friends and to their willingness to adapt to changing
circumstances in ways that sustain their social connections. For
example, children now often have schedules as busy as their
parents. Yet today's parents spend more quality time with their
children than parents did forty years ago---although less in the
form of organized home activities and more in the form of
accompanying them to play dates or sports activities. And those
family meals at home that seem to be disappearing? While survey
research shows that families dine at home together less often,
it also shows that they dine out together more often. Americans
are fascinated by the quality of their relationships with family
and friends and whether these bonds fray or remain stable over
time. With so many voices heralding the demise of personal
relationships, it's no wonder that confusion on this topic
abounds. An engrossing and accessible social history, Still
Connected brings a much-needed note of clarity to the
discussion. Americans' personal ties, this book assures us,
remain strong.},

abstract = {The terms habit and routine have come to be used with increasing frequency in debates about  behaviour' change and sustainable consumption, where dominant approaches, dubbed as  portfolio models of action' by their critics, employ these terms to capture human deficiencies in the translation of pro-environmental values into corresponding actions (the  value-action' gap). Alternative approaches present habits and routines as the observable performances of stable practices. Informed by these approaches, this article makes three  conceptual moves' in order to demonstrate the need for empirical attention to the temporal conditioning of everyday practices. First, it is argued that conceptual usages of the terms  habit' and  routine' are often imprecise and used generically to capture many different aspects of human action. A threefold conceptual framework comprising of  dispositions',  procedures' and  sequences' is proposed as a preliminary step in dealing with this problem. Second, it is suggested that generic uses of the terms  habit' and  routine' imply multiple forms of temporality. Again, as a conceptual sorting exercise, three categories of temporality pertinent to understanding the performance of practices are examined: time as a resource; the temporal demands of practices; and temporal rhythms. Third, the relationships between the conceptual variants of habitual and routine actions and temporalities of practices are examined through reference to empirical research. In conclusion, it is argued that reducing habits and routines to generic descriptions of behaviour within portfolio models of action is inadequate for developing understandings of the reproduction of everyday practices. Rather, empirical and conceptual attention to the relationships between practices, temporalities and different forms of action are required if the challenge of fostering more sustainable ways of life is to be met.},

It hypothesizes that practices which demand a fixed location within daily schedules   anchor temporal organization, around which are sequenced sets of interrelated practices.

The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration.

abstract = {Empirical findings show that the success of marriages and other intimate partnerships depends on objective attributes such as differences of age, cultural background, or educational levels between partners. However, one previous publication that considers the marriage market as a stock to be optimized using a branch and bound algorithm triggered numerous and passionate public reactions. Therefore this chapter proposes on the one hand an enhancement of the model we used previously to optimally allocate partners within the set of structural constraints defining the marriage market. On the other hand it offers a critical discussion concerning the potential and limits of using such econometric methods in social sciences. Based on a representative and longitudinal sample of 1074 cohabitating and married couples in Switzerland, we estimate various objective functions corresponding to age, education, religion, devotion, ethnicity, depression, and previous divorce experience based on all possible pairs of men and women belonging to the sample. Results show that the current state of marriages or partnerships is well below the social optimum. Approximately three individuals out of four are reallocated to a couple with a higher chance of survival than the actual couple to which they belong. Of course this provocative stance does not support the idea that optimizing marriage is indeed possible or desirable. Instead, it claims that critically considering the social structures that influence marriage and divorce is a useful mission for the social sciences. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

As women have markedly increased their time in paid work, they have curtailed their time in housework. Surprisingly, those who become mothers have not cut back their time with children, on average, but they may be “multitasking” when doing child care and this may add to their increased sense of time pressure. Men are changing as well: with some increase in housework and a sizable increase in time with children among fathers who live with their children. However, a gender leisure gap (favoring men) has emerged where none existed before.},

Use of the concept of social capital is part of a general theoretical strategy discussed in the paper: taking rational action as a starting point but rejecting the extreme individ- ualistic premises that often accompany it. The conception of social capital as a resource for action is one way of introducing social structure into the rational action paradigm. Three forms of so- cial capital are examined: obligations and expectations, information channels, and social norms. The role of closure in the social struc- ture in facilitating the first and third of these forms of social capital is described. An analysis of the effect of the lack of social capital available to high school sophomores on dropping out of school be- fore graduation is carried out. The effect of social capital within the family and in the community outside the family is examined.},

This concept, borrowed from social sciences, has three distinct sociological sources.

Social capital poses three kinds of problem: i) theoretical problems, because it is defined by its effects rather than by its causes, and because it is presumed that these effects are positive, although they can in fact be negative; ii) methodological problems, because of the heterogeneity of empirical scales, from micro to macro, and because of the diversity of its semantic content, including contradictions; iii) political problems, because of the emphasis placed on individual responsibility and due to the imposition of a model of civic virtue, to the detriment of structural analysis.},

In this paper I use time-use diary data to focus upon three important aspects of the gendered experience of time. These are the social context of domestic tasks in relation to their (gendered) patterns of management, the intensity or density of time-use involving combinations of different activities, and the fragmentation of leisure time according to which activities are responsible for interrupting it. Overall these analyses support the conclusion that women's time is not only more pressured in terms of the intensity of domestic tasks, but that the more enjoyable aspects of their time, such as leisure time, tend to be more fragmented than that of men.},

We show that men are more voracious than women but that the pattern of the relationship with social status is not significantly different: individuals with higher levels of human, economic and cultural capital are more voracious than others regardless of gender. However, we find support for a reinforcement effect of gender and social status, which creates the greatest differential in voraciousness between men with the highest social status and women with the lowest, lending support to the idea that voracious cultural consumption acts as a marker of social boundaries and a sign of social exclusion.},

This article uses the Australian Time Use Survey to identify associations between self-employment and mothers' and fathers' time in paid work, domestic labour and childcare and when during the day they perform these activities. The time self-employed mothers devote to each activity differs substantially from that of employee mothers, while fathers' time is relatively constant across employment types. Working from home is highly correlated with self-employment for mothers, implying the opportunity to be home-based is a pull factor in mothers becoming self-employed. Results suggest mothers use self-employment to combine earning and childcare whereas fathers prioritize paid work regardless of employment type. Self-employment is not associated with gender redistribution of paid and unpaid work, although it facilitates some rescheduling.},

Americans from the 1996 General Social Survey, we examine

For men, imbalance is predicted by longer work hours, wives who
work fewer hours, perceived unfairness in sharing housework,
marital unhappiness, and tradeoffs made at work for family and at
home for work. For women, only marital unhappiness and sacrifices
at home are imbalancing, and for women who are employed

Since the 1980s, portable microcomputer systems and physiological recorders/analyzers have been developed for this purpose. In contrast to their use in medicine, these new methods have hardly entered the domain of psychology. Questionnaire methods are still preferred, in spite of the known deficiencies of retrospective self-reports. Assessment strategies include: continuous monitoring, monitoring with time- and event-sampling methods, in-field psychological testing, field experimentation, interactive assessment, symptom monitoring, and self-management. These approaches are innovative and address ecological validity, context specificity, and are suitable for practical applications. The advantages of this methodology, as well as issues of acceptance, compliance, and reactivity are discussed. Many technical developments and research contributions have come from the German-speaking countries and the Netherlands. Nonetheless, the current Decade of Behavior (APA) calls for a more widespread use of such techniques and developments in assessment. This position paper seeks to make the case for this approach by demonstrating the advantages--and in some domains--necessities of ambulatory monitoring methodology for a behavioral science orientation in psychology. },

@article{Folland2007,
abstract = {Robert Putnam showed that a social capital index, created as a weighted sum of 14 variables chosen to describe the civic degree of sociability and community mindedness, is correlated with many community outcomes, such as education, child well-being, crime, and the total mortality rate. Although correlation does not establish causation, we can find that in a large number of studies this index, a selection of its elements, or similar measures register as significantly correlated with health variables, virtually always in a direction consistent with the hypothesis that social capital improves health. The potential benefit of this relationship is substantial, especially if it proves to be robust to differences in time and place, statistical contexts, and ultimately if the relation can be supported to be causal. This paper subjects the social capital and health hypothesis to an expanded set of rigorous tests, which, by surviving, it becomes stronger or, by failing, its weaknesses are better revealed. The paper seeks to extend this body of research by a combination of study characteristics that are each relatively unusual in social capital and health research. Though causality cannot be established by these tests, the work shows that the association of social capital with health is quite robust when challenged in the following ways: (1) seven different health measures are studied, including five mortality rates; (2) the 48 contiguous states are observed at six points in time covering the years from 1978 to 1998 over four year intervals, thus forming a panel; (3) the multivariate tests feature economic variables from the production of health literature; and (4) a statistical method (instrumental variables) is applied to account for the possibility that omitted variables are confounding the social capital estimates. The results and the discussion find cases for which the social capital and health hypothesis performs only weakly, but, on the whole, the hypothesis is remarkably robust to these variations. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

the primary motivations for its study but, until recently, has
rarely been tested empirically. I review the literature on the

But the means they find to cope with this load, and how these means relate to the factors underpinning the division of labor are not often studied.

N=. 4196 couples), we find domestic outsourcing is related to having dependent children and to partners' resources, but has little impact on the total domestic/caring workload of either partner. Nor can outsourcing account for the reduction in women's unpaid labor with increasing economic resources. Wives spend more time multitasking than husbands, but their proportion of multitasked domestic time is similar, and is not affected by resources or dependent children. Domestic multitasking seems to be more related to opportunity (time at home) than to time pressure. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

award-winning author and psychologist Susan Pinker shows how
face-to-face contact is crucial for learning, happiness,
resilience and longevity. From birth to death, human beings are
hard-wired to connect to other human beings. Face-to-face
contact matters: tight bonds of friendship and love heal us,
help children learn, extend our lives and make us happy. Looser
in-person bonds matter, too, combining with our close
relationships to form a personal ``village'' around us, one that
exerts unique effects. And not just any social networks will do:
we need the real, face-to-face, in-the-flesh encounters that tie
human families, groups of friends and communities together.
Marrying the findings of the new field of social neuroscience
together with gripping human stories, Susan Pinker explores the
impact of face-to-face contact from cradle to grave, from city
to Sardinian mountain village, from classroom to workplace, from
love to marriage to divorce. Her results are enlightening and
enlivening, and they challenge our assumptions. Most of us have
left the literal village behind, and don't want to give up our
new technologies to go back there. But, as Pinker writes so
compellingly, we need close social bonds and uninterrupted
face-time with our friends and families in order to thrive--even
to survive. Creating our own ``village effect'' can make us
happier. It can also save our lives.},

@article{Southerton2003,
abstract = {The `time squeeze', notions of `rush' and `harried' are popular concerns in contemporary society. This article reports on interviews with 20 suburban households who all suggested that people feel increasingly harried. Respondents were quick to suggest a set of generic narratives to explain the causes of `harriedness', notably that people `work more' and `consume more' - the same explanation offered by prominent academic analyses. However, such explanations did not tally with their `experiences' of harriedness. It is argued that `harriedness' was generated by a felt need to allocate and schedule practices within designated time frames (which created hot spots). This was `necessary' in order to coordinate practices within social networks and to `free-up' other time frames (cold spots) for interaction with significant others. On the one hand, this suggests a rationalized conception of time as subject to personal control. On the other, such individual responses (to schedule and allocate) to the perceived `time squeeze' were responses to a collective problem. In a society where increasingly people feel the need to generate personal schedules, temporal alignment within networks becomes problematic. In attempting to schedule practices, which often required employment of convenience devices and services, respondents reported a growing anxiety that care is compromised by convenience. It was this anxiety that made the `time squeeze' discourse meaningful to respondents.},

@article{Burgard2013,
abstract = {Do women really sleep more than men? Biomedical and social scientific studies show longer sleep durations for women, a surprising finding given sociological research showing women have more unpaid work and less high-quality leisure time compared to men. We assess explanations for gender differences in time for sleep, including compositional differences in levels of engagement in paid and unpaid labor, gendered responses to work and family responsibilities, and differences in napping, bedtimes, and interrupted sleep for caregiving. We examine the overall gender gap in time for sleep as well as gaps within family life-course stages based on age, partnership, and parenthood statuses. We analyze minutes of sleep from a diary day collected from nationally representative samples of working-age adults in the American Time Use Surveys of 2003 to 2007. Overall and at most life course stages, women slept more than men. Much of the gap is explained by work and family responsibilities and gendered time tradeoffs; as such, gender differences vary across life course stages. The gender gap in sleep time favoring women is relatively small for most comparisons and should be considered in light of the gender gap in leisure time favoring men at all life course stages.},

abstract = {Women are increasingly allocating time to the paid workforce, but there has not been a corresponding change by men allocating equivalent time to domestic and caring   labour. In the absence of sufficient institutional and domestic support, women continue to supply the bulk of time required to care for children. This amounts to only half a sex revolution and raises the question of whether becoming a parent creates welfare differences between mothers and fathers, and/or between mothers and non-mothers. This article addresses this issue by analysing data from the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Time Use Survey to investigate the impact of children on adults' (paid and unpaid) workload. The results show that the time impact of becoming a parent is considerable, but very unevenly distributed by sex. Having children markedly intensifies gender inequities in time allocation by increasing specialization and women's workload},

the 2010 Well-Being Module. The results indicated that
individuals in full-time working dual-earner couples spend
similar amounts of time together as individuals in traditional
breadwinner-homemaker arrangements on weekdays after
accounting for daily work demands. The findings also show that
parents share significantly less total and exclusive spousal
time together than nonparents, though there is considerable
variation among parents by age of the youngest child. Of
significance is that individuals experience greater happiness
and meaning and less stress during time spent with a spouse
opposed to time spent apart.},

abstract = {Using a newspaper questionnaire, a door-to-door survey, and 3 laboratory experiments, the authors examined a proposed effect of shared participation in novel and arousing activities on experienced relationship quality. The questionnaire and survey studies found predicted correlations of reported shared "exciting" activities and relationship satisfaction plus their predicted mediation by relationship boredom. In all 3 experiments, the authors found predicted greater increases in experienced relationship quality from before to after participating together in a 7-min novel and arousing (vs. a more mundane) task. Comparison with a no-activity control showed the effect was due to the novel-arousing task. The same effect was found on ratings of videotaped discussions before and after the experimental task. Finally, all results remained after controlling for relationship social desirability. Results bear on general issues of boredom and excitement in relationships and the role of such processes in understanding the typical early decline of relationship quality after the honeymoon period. This article focuses on a proposed effect on relationship quality of shared participation in novel and arousing activities (over and above any effect of shared participation in more mundane activi-ties). This proposed effect bears on basic motivational and cogni-tive mechanisms underlying excitement and boredom in long-term relationships and has significant potential practical applications. We first briefly explore the background and preliminary re-search suggesting that such an effect should occur. We then present data from two questionnaire studies, each of which show the predicted pattern of associations, and then a series of three experiments, which demonstrate the effect under controlled labo-ratory conditions and establish an innovative practical paradigm for future research exploring more deeply the underlying mechanisms.},

abstract = {Similarity breeds connection. This principle—the homophily principle—structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties be- tween nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

abstract = {Social capital has become one of the most popular topics in public health research in recent years. However, even after a decade of conceptual and empirical work on this subject, there is still considerable disagreement about whether bonding social capital is a collective resource that benefits communities or societies, or whether its health benefits are associated with people, their personal networks and support. Using data from the 2000 and 2002 Health Survey for England this study found that, in line with earlier research, personal levels of social support contribute to a better self-reported health status. The study also suggests that social capital is additionally important for people's health. In both datasets the aggregate social trust variable was significantly related to self-rated health before and after controlling for differences in socio-demographics and/or individual levels of social support. The results were corroborated in the second dataset with an alternative indicator of social capital. These results show that bonding social capital collectively contributes to people's self-rated health over and above the beneficial effects of personal social networks and support.},

But the benefits from social capital are likely to be unequally distributed. Given these features, documenting empirically the benefits of social capital is complicated by the presence of negative and positive externalities and by the existence of leadership and group effects.

We use extensive empirical evidence from Fertility and Family Survey data, providing a large-scale comparison. We focus on some key indicators of the process of leaving home: the timing, sequencing and synchronisation of leaving home with the end of education and the formation of a first union. As far as these dimensions of leaving home are concerned, Europe appears to be extremely heterogeneous, and explaining this will undoubtedly be a challenge. The complex interplay between the present economic situation of young people and long-term institutional and cultural factors is thought to be the main driving factor.

comparative analysis, cohabitation, and gender-specific analysis.
It is not clear if the married-happiness relationship is

We address these issues using data from 17 national surveys. A
multiple regression analysis determined that the relationship
between marital status and happiness holds in 16 of the 17
nations and the strength of the association does not vary
significantly in 14 of the 17 nations. Being married was 3.4
times more closely tied to the variance in happiness than was
cohabitation, and marriage increases happiness equally among men
and women. Marriage may affect happiness through two intervening
processes: the promotion of financial satisfaction and the
improvement of health. These intervening processes did not
replicate for cohabitants.},

in divorce in the United States. We find that both vital
statistics and retrospective survey data on divorce after 1990
underestimate recent marital instability. These flawed data
have led some analysts to conclude that divorce has been
stable or declining for the past three decades. Using new data
from the American Community Survey and controlling for changes
in the age composition of the married population, we conclude
that there was actually a substantial increase in
age-standardized divorce rates between 1990 and 2008. Divorce
rates have doubled over the past two decades among persons
over age 35. Among the youngest couples, however, divorce
rates are stable or declining. If current trends continue,
overall age-standardized divorce rates could level off or even
decline over the next few decades. We argue that the leveling
of divorce among persons born since 1980 probably reflects the

to policy makers and many users of official statistics. This
research used a sample of adults (from the Office for National
Statistics Longitudinal Study) who were in a partnership
(married or cohabiting) in the 1991 Census of England and
Wales, and then explored whether these individuals were living
with the same partner in 2001.Marital partnerships were found
to be more stable, even when additional factors were taken
into account. Of adults aged 16 to 54, around four in five
adults (82 per cent) that were married in 1991 were living
with the same partner in 2001. The equivalent figure for
adults cohabiting in 1991 was around three in five (61 per
cent), of whom around two-thirds (of those remaining with the
same partner) had converted their cohabitation to a marriage
by 2001. Long-running partnership stability was also found to
vary according to the socio-demographic characteristics of
individuals and their partners and a summary of these
variations is discussed.List of tables, 39.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, social capital in its various forms and contexts has emerged as one of the most salient concepts in social sciences . While much excitement has been generated, divergent views, perspectives, and expectations have also raised the serious question : is it a fad or does it have enduring qualities that will herald a new intellectual enterprise? This presentation's purpose is to review social capital as discussed in the literature, identify controversies and debates, consider some critical issues, and propose conceptual and research strategies in building a theory. I will argue that such a theory and the research enterprise must be based on the fundamental understanding that social capital is captured from embedded resources in social networks . Deviations from this understanding in conceptualization and measurement lead to confusion in analyzing causal mechanisms in the macro- and microprocesses. It is precisely these mechanisms and processes, essential for an interactive theory about structure and action, to which social capital promises to make contributions . The paper will begin by exploring the nature of capital and various theories of capital, so that social capital can be properly perceived and located . It will then identify certain controversies which, unless clarified or resolved, will hinder the development of a theory and the research enterprise . By considering social capital as assets in networks, the paper will discuss some issues in conceptualizations, measurements, and causal mechanisms (the factors leading to inequality of social capital and the returns following investments in social capital) . A proposed model will follow . The paper will conclude by calling attention to the rise of a new form of social capital, cybernetworks, and briefly suggesting how research on this topic promises to make important contributions to the research enterprise .},

abstract = {Modernization theorists from Karl Marx to Daniel Bell have argued
that economic development brings pervasive cultural changes. But
others, from Max Weber to Samuel Huntington, have claimed that
cultural values are an enduring and autonomous influence on
society. We test the thesis that economic development is linked
with systematic changes in basic values. Using data from the
three waves of the World Values Surveys, which include 65
societies and 75 percent of the world's population, we find
evidence of both massive cultural change and the persistence of
distinctive cultural traditions. Economic development is
associated with shifts away from absolute norms and values toward
values that are increasingly rational, tolerant, trusting, and
participatory. Cultural change, however, is path dependent. The
broad cultural heritage of a society-Protestant, Roman Catholic,
Orthodox, Confucian, or Communist-leaves an imprint on values
that endures despite modernization. Moreover, the differences
between the values held by members of different religions within
given societies are much smaller than are cross-national
differences. Once established, such cross-cultural differences
become part of a national culture transmitted by educational
institutions and mass media. We conclude with some proposed
revisions of modernization theory.},

abstract = {A fundamental switch in the fertility—development relationship has occurred so that among highly developed countries, further socioeconomic development may reverse the declining fertility trend. Here we shed light on the mechanisms underlying this reversal by analyzing the links between development and age and cohort patterns of fertility, as well as the role of gender equality. Using data from 1975 to 2008 for over 100 countries, we show that the reversal exists both in a period and a cohort perspective and is mainly driven by increasing older reproductive-age fertility. We also show that the positive impact of development on fertility in high-development countries is conditional on gender equality: countries ranking high in development as measured by health, income, and education but low in gender equality continue to experience declining fertility. Our findings suggest that gender equality is crucial for countries wishing to reap the fertility dividend of high development.},

This study tests two competing hypotheses of whether nonstandard schedules result in lower levels of parent--child interaction or in more time with children. Using the first wave of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study of 1,266 couples with young children and data from semistructured individual (N = 27) qualitative interviews of respondents with children, the authors engage in a series of ordered logit regression models and qualitative correspondence and narrative analysis. The central finding is that nonstandard schedules are significantly related to an increase in joint activities of parents and children and caregiving for fathers. Qualitative interviews reveal strategies families develop to maintain alternative times and types of contact. Couples use nonstandard schedules to desynchronize schedules to avoid formalized child care and engage in ``tag-team parenting'' to ensure that one parent is always present.},
